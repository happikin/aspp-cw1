# ASPP coursework 1

Please see Learn for submission deadlines.

Remember what you submit must be your own work. Anything not your own
work which you have include should be correctly referenced and
cited. You must not share this assessment's source code nor your
solutions. 

Academic integrity is an underlying principle of research and academic
practice. All submitted work is expected to be your own. AI tools
(e.g., ELM) should not be used for this assessment.

Please see further information and guidance from the School of
Informatics:

## Summary

Your goals:

1. Understand the core algorithm (`step()` in `wave_cpu.cpp`) and
estimate the maximum performance acheiveable on a single A100 GPU
available on the EIDF.

2. Using both OpenMP (in `wave_omp.cpp`) and CUDA (in `wave_cuda.cu`)
adapt the CPU-only code and make it run correctly and efficiently on a
single GPU.

3. Describe this in a brief report.

As part of marking, your code will be compiled and run automatically.
It is essential you pay careful attention to the instructions for
submission.


## Problem

Here we are solving the wave equation in 3D, using the simplest
method: an explicit, second-order in both space and time finite
difference code. The model has a variable speed of sound and a simple
boundary damping to reduce reflections in the x and y directions.

When run, the code will produce three (one each for CPU, OpenMP, CUDA)
output files in HDF5 format which can be read by VTK, or tools based
on it such as ParaView, and visualised. It will also produce timing
and performance information to standard output.

## Set up

Clone this repository on the EIDF (please see Learn for the path),
remembering to use your PVC directory.

Configure with CMake. Note: for marking, we will use a build mode of
`Release`, which is the default, but you may wish to include basic
debug info for testing while doing your development.

```
cmake -S src -B build-dev -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```


Compile
```
cmake --build build-dev
```

The unmodified code will run on the ASPP VM (as it doesn't use the
GPUs!) but once you start work, you will need to use the compute
nodes. We have provided very basic job descriptions for testing and
profiling - you should try parameters other than the defaults as we
will use others to mark.

The application first runs a CPU reference simulation then the CUDA
and OpenMP versions, comparing the results of the latter two to the
former with some tolerance. It then reports on timing information.

Usage:
```
awave [-shape int,int,int] [-dx float] [-dt float] \
      [-nsteps int] [-out_period int] [output_base]
```

* `-shape` is the size of the simulation domain in grid points
* `-dx` grid spacing in metres
* `-dt` time step in seconds
* `-nsteps` number of time steps
* `-out_period` number of time steps between writing data
* `output_base` the base  (i.e. no extension) for the output files

For your purposes changing the the shape should be sufficient (we may
change the time and space resolution during marking, but this must be
done with some care to ensure numerical stability, understanding of
which is not relevant to this course).

## Requirements

You need to prepare a brief report and adapt the code (only the files
`wave_cuda.cu` and `wave_omp.cpp`) to use a single GPU with the best
performance you can. We recommend using the `NVIDIA-A100-SXM4-40GB`
GPU type (not the MIG GPU slices) once you are looking at performance
as this will be used for testing.

### Report

This should be in PDF format, with a maximum of three pages and a font
size of at least 10pts. Please include these three sections
below. Introduction and conclusions are not required. Remember to
properly cite any sources. [Suggested length allocations in brackets.]

1. Estimate the best performance (for example in site updates per
   second, where a "site update" is performing one time step's
   integration for a single grid point) achievable on one A100 GPU
   (`NVIDIA-A100-SXM4-40GB`) on the EIDF. This should be based on your
   analysis of the code (the function `step` in `wave_cpu.cpp` for
   example) and the theoretical performance limits of the device as
   published by NVIDIA. [Half a page or less]

2. Explain the choices you made and how they give good performance,
   with reference to the hardware, programming models, and performance
   evidence gathered along the way to your solution. You should cover
   a range of problem sizes from 32--1000 along any dimension. Ensure
   you comment on how your observed performance compares to your
   estimate from part 1. [1-2 pages]

3. Comment on the differences between your two implementations, in
   terms of performance and ease of implementation, as well as any
   other points you consider signficant. Make a recommendation, with
   reasons, as to which programming model you would use if you could
   pick only one. [0.5-1 pages]

### Code

Adapt the code to use the GPU efficiently with both OpenMP and CUDA,
based on the material in the course.

a) Use OpenMP target offload in the file `wave_omp.cpp`

b) Use CUDA in the file `wave_cuda.cu`

Both versions will be assessed for correctness, performance, and
clarity. It is important, therefore, that you test and profile this on
the EIDF full A100s (`NVIDIA-A100-SXM4-40GB`) which we will use for
marking.

You will be submitting *only* the files mentioned in (a) & (b) above,
so please localise your changes to those files (you can always check
with `git status`) as we will keep the rest of the application as is
supplied in the repo. The supplied code has further advice in the
source files.

*Clarity*: your modifications will be marked for good software
engineering practice. Recall that you are explaining to an experienced
programmer how the CPU and GPU will coordinate to solve a problem.

*Correctness*: the driver program compares both GPU results to those
from the (unmodified) serial CPU version. We will compile and run this
against a range of problem shapes, thus you should also in your
testing. Ensure the program correctly manages any resources it uses.

*Performance*: we will use several problems of different sizes, taking
the best performance run in each case. Sizes will be between 32 and
1000 inclusive along each dimension.

## Submission

Please create a gzipped tar file which unpacks as follows:
```
examno/wave_cuda.cu
examno/wave_omp.cpp
examno/<sensible report name>.pdf
```

We have provided a script that will create this for you: 
```
./make_submission.sh -h
Usage: ./make_submission.sh (-h |-e <exam number> -r <path/to/report>)
Create a submission-ready tarball as aspp-cw1-<exam number>.tar.gz
  -h print this message and exit without doing anything
  -e your exam number, the one that starts with a 'B' and has six numbers after
  -r your report in PDF format please

Both -e and -r options are required to produce a tarball.
```

## Marking rubric

Marks for the report will be awarded according to the following scheme:

   80% An excellent report, fully addressing all points above, and
       presenting convincing evidence/results. The report is written
       and presented to a professional standard.

70-80% A very good report, addressing all points to a good standard,
	   and presenting evidence and results that supports the claims
	   made, irrelevant text is minimal. The report is well written
	   and presented.

60-70% A good report, addressing all the points with only minor
	   omissions or confusion. Some irrelevancies, but not detracting
	   from the report generally. Evidence and results support the
	   points made, but perhaps not to the extent claimed. Writing and
	   presentation generally good.

50-60% An OK report, addressing all of the points required at least
	   partially but perhaps showing some faulty reasoning, minor
	   confusions or longer passages of irrelevant
	   material. Evidence/results are present but not convincing or
	   contains minor inaccuracies. Writing and presentation are
	   generally satisfactory but with some brief lapses.

40-50% A poor report with either significant omissions, failures in
       reasoning or that contains significant irrelevant
       material. Evidence or results have significant omissions or do
       not support the claims made. Writing and presentation have
       significant flaws.

  <40% A weak effort which is incomplete or incomprehensible

Marks for the codes will be awarded according to the following scheme:

   80% Correct, very well-designed code which, clearly and succintly,
	   explains how the CPU and GPU coordinate to get performance,
	   very good performance, likely using one or more advanced
	   techniques.

70-80% Correct well-designed code with clear explanation of CPU/GPU
	   use, and good performance.

60-70% Correct code, with generally clear GPU/CPU use and good
	   performance. Likely doing the basics well or attempting the
	   more advanced techniques with minor problems.

50-60% Code with minor errors, some oversights in explaining GPU/CPU
	   use and some design and/or performance issues. May fail to
	   properly consider an important performance issue.

40-50% Code with more serious errors, poor design and/or poor
       performance. No serious attempt to make clear the how
       GPU/CPU coordinate.

  <40% Badly broken or incomplete code and/or very bad
       design. Description/comments missing or incomprehensible.
