Initialising CPU simulation from parameters...
Grid shape: [128, 128, 128]
Grid spacing: 10 m
Time step: 0.002 s
Number of steps: 100
Output period: 100
Initial pressure field is pulse in middle of domain
Speed of sound is simple ocean depth model
Damping field to avoid reflections in x & y directions (large quiet ocean)
